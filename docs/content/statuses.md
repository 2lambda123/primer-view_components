title: Component status
---

Each component is given a status that explains the component's maturity level.


| Status         | Meaning                                                                |
| -------------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Alpha`        | Experimental. Breaking changes are likely.                             |
| `Beta`         | Usage encouraged, but not required.                                    |
| `Stable`       | Usage expected.                                                        |
| `Deprecated`   | Usage not allowed. May be removed at any time.                         |

We expect many components to move from alpha to beta and from beta to stable
soon. Feel free to watch for releases in the
[repo](https://github.com/primer/view_components).

You can also see component status at a glance on [this project
board](https://github.com/primer/view_components/projects/3).
